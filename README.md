# 🎯 Event-Based Video Recorder Using YOLOv8

## 🚀 Overview
This project continuously buffers webcam video and uses AI-based event detection (YOLOv8) to automatically record short clips whenever certain objects (like **person, car, dog, cat, etc.**) appear.

It is part of the **internship technical assignment** on Event-Based Video Recording Using AI Event Detection.
